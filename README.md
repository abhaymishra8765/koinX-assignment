Trade Parsing and Balance Calculator

Here I have developed a server side application using Node.js and MongoDB in which i have accomplished two tasks.

Task 1 : Implemented an API that accepts a CSV file as the input, parses the data present in it
and stores it in a database.

Task 2: Implemented an API that would give the asset-wise balance of the account at any
given timestamp.

Have a nice day!
